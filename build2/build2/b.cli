     \h|DESCRIPTION|

     The \cb{build2} build system driver executes a set of meta-operations on
     operations on targets according to the build specification, or
     \i{buildspec} for short.  This process can be controlled by specifying
     driver <options> and build system <variables>.

     Note that <options>, <variables>, and <buildspec> fragments can be
     specified in any order. To avoid treating an argument that starts with
     \cb{'-'} as an option, add the \cb{'--'} separator. To avoid treating an
     argument that contains \cb{'='} as a variable, add the second \cb{'--'}
     separator."
  }

  // For usage it's nice to see the list of options on the first page. So
  // let's not put this "extended" description into usage.
  //
  {
    "<meta-operation> <operation> <target> <parameters> <src-base>",
    "",

    "All components in the buildspec can be omitted. If <meta-operation> is
     omitted, then it defaults to \cb{perform}. If <operation> is omitted,
     then it defaults to the default operation for this meta-operation. For
     \cb{perform} it is \cb{update}. Finally, if <target> is omitted, then it
     defaults to the current working directory. A meta-operation on operation
     is called an \i{action}. Some operations and meta-operations may take
     additional <parameters>. For example:

     \
     $ b                       # perform(update(./))
     $ b foo/                  # perform(update(foo/))
     $ b foo/ bar/             # perform(update(foo/ bar/))
     $ b update                # perform(update(./))
     $ b 'clean(../)'          # perform(clean(../))
     $ b perform               # perform(update(./))
     $ b configure             # configure(?(./))
     $ b 'configure(../)'      # configure(?(../))
     $ b clean update          # perform(clean(./) update(./))
     $ b configure update      # configure(?(./)) perform(update(./))
     $ b 'create(conf/, cxx)'  # create(?(conf/), cxx)
     \

     Notice the question mark used to show the (imaginary) default operation
     for the \cb{configure} meta-operation. For \cb{configure} the default
     operation is \"all operations\". That is, it will configure all the
     operations for the specified target.

     You can also \"generate\" multiple operations for the same set of targets.
     Compare:

     \
     $ b 'clean(foo/ bar/)' 'update(foo/ bar/)'
     $ b '{clean update}(foo/ bar/)'
     \

     Some more useful buildspec examples:

     \
     $ b '{clean update}(...)'        # rebuild
     $ b '{clean update clean}(...)'  # make sure builds
     $ b '{clean test clean}(...)'    # make sure passes tests
     $ b '{clean disfigure}(...)'     # similar to distclean
     \

     In POSIX shells parenthesis are special characters and must be quoted
     when used in a buildspec. Besides being an inconvenience in itself,
     quoting also inhibits path auto-completion. To help with this situation a
     shortcut syntax is available for executing a single operation or
     meta-operation, for example:

     \
     $ b clean: foo/ bar/                # clean(foo/ bar/)
     $ b configure: src/@out/            # configure(src/@out/)
     $ b create: conf/, cxx              # create(conf/, cxx)
     $ b configure: config.cxx=g++ src/  # configure(src/) config.cxx=g++
     \

     To activate the shortcut syntax the first buildspec argument must start
     with an operation or meta-operation name and end with a colon (\cb{:}).
     To transform the shortcut syntax to the normal buildspec syntax the colon
     is replaced with the opening parenthesis ('\cb{(}'), the rest of the
     buildspec arguments are treated as is, and the final closing parenthesis
     ('\cb{)}') is added.

     For each <target> the driver expects to find \cb{buildfile} either in the
     target's directory or, if the directory is part of the \cb{out} tree
     (\cb{out_base}), in the corresponding \cb{src} directory (\cb{src_base}).

     For example, assuming \cb{foo/} is the source directory of a project:

     \
     $ b foo/              # out_base=src_base=foo/
     $ b foo-out/          # out_base=foo-out/ src_base=foo/
     $ b foo-out/exe{foo}  # out_base=foo-out/ src_base=foo/
     \

     An exception to this requirement is a directory target in which case,
     provided the directory has subdirectories, an \i{implied} \cb{buildfile}
     with the following content is assumed:

     \
     # Implied directory buildfile: build all subdirectories.
     #
     ./: */
     \

     In the above example, we assumed that the build system driver was able to
     determine the association between \cb{out_base} and \cb{src_base}. In
     case \cb{src_base} and \cb{out_base} are not the same directory, this is
     achieved in one of two ways: the \cb{config} module (which implements the
     \cb{configure}, \cb{disfigure}, and \cb{create} meta-operations) saves
     this association as part of the configuration process. If, however, the
     association hasn't been saved, then we have to specify \cb{src_base}
     explicitly using the following extended <target> syntax:

     \c{<src-base>/@<target>}

     Continuing with the previous example:

     \
     $ b foo/@foo-out/exe{foo}  # out_base=foo-out/ src_base=foo/
     \

     Normally, you would need to specify \cb{src_base} explicitly only once,
     during configuration. For example, a typical usage would be:

     \
     $ b configure: foo/@foo-out/  # src_base is saved
     $ b foo-out/                  # no need to specify src_base
     $ b clean: foo-out/exe{foo}   # no need to specify src_base
     \

     Besides in and out of source builds, \cb{build2} also supports
     configuring a project's source directory as \i{forwarded} to an out of
     source build. With such a forwarded configuration in place, if we run the
     build system driver from the source directory, it will automatically
     build in the output directory and \i{backlink} (using symlinks or another
     suitable mechanism) certain \"interesting\" targets (executables,
     documentation, etc) to the source directory for easy access. Continuing
     with the previous example:

     \
     $ b configure: foo/@foo-out/,forward  # foo/ forwarded to foo-out/
     $ cd foo/
     $ b                                   # build in foo-out/
     $ ./foo                               # symlink to foo-out/foo
     \

     The ability to specify \cb{build2} variables as part of the command line
     is normally used to pass configuration values, for example:

     \
     $ b config.cxx=clang++ config.cxx.coptions=-O3
     \

     Similar to buildspec, POSIX shells often inhibit path auto-completion on
     the right hand side of a variable assignment. To help with this situation
     the assignment can be broken down into three separate command line
     arguments, for example:

     \
     $ b config.import.libhello = ../libhello/
     \

     The build system has the following built-in and pre-defined
     meta-operations:

     \dl|

     \li|\cb{perform}

         Perform an operation.|

     \li|\cb{configure}

         Configure all operations supported by a project and save the result
         in the project's \cb{build/config.build} file. Implemented by the
         \cb{config} module. For example:

         \
         $ b configure                      \
             config.cxx=clang++             \
             config.cxx.coptions=-O3        \
             config.install.root=/usr/local \
             config.install.root.sudo=sudo
         \

         Use the \cb{forward} parameter to instead configure a source
         directory as forwarded to an out of source build. For example:

         \
         $ b configure: src/@out/,forward
         \

         |

     \li|\cb{disfigure}

         Disfigure all operations supported by a project and remove the
         project's \cb{build/config.build} file. Implemented by the
         \cb{config} module.

         Use the \cb{forward} parameter to instead disfigure forwarding of a
         source directory to an out of source build. For example:

         \
         $ b disfigure: src/,forward
         \

         |

     \li|\cb{create}

         Create and configure a \i{configuration} project. Implemented by the
         \cb{config} module.

         Normally a \cb{build2} project is created manually by writing the
         \cb{bootstrap.build} and \cb{config.build} files, adding source
         files, and so on. However, a special kind of project, which we call
         \i{configuration}, is often useful. Such a project doesn't have any
         source files of its own. Instead, it serves as an amalgamation for
         building other projects as part of it. Doing it this way has two
         major benefits: sub-projects automatically resolve their imports
         to other projects in the amalgamation and sub-projects inherits their
         configuration from the amalgamation (which means if we want to change
         something, we only need to do it in one place).

         As an example, let's assume we have two C++ projects: the
         \cb{libhello} library in \cb{libhello/} and the \cb{hello} executable
         that imports it in \cb{hello/}. And we want to build \cb{hello} with
         \cb{clang++}.

         One way to do it would be to configure and build each project in its
         own directory, for example:

         \
         $ b configure: libhello/@libhello-clang/ config.cxx=clang++
         $ b configure: hello/@hello-clang/ config.cxx=clang++ \
             config.import.libhello=libhello-clang/
         \

         The two drawbacks, as mentioned above, are the need to explicitly
         resolve the import and having to make changes in multiple places
         should, for example, we want to switch from \cb{clang++} to \cb{g++}.

         We can, however, achieve the same end result but without any of the
         drawbacks using the configuration project:

         \
         $ b create: clang/,cxx config.cxx=clang++  # Creates clang/.
         $ b configure: libhello/@clang/libhello/
         $ b configure: hello/@clang/hello/
         \

         The targets passed to the \cb{create} meta-operation must be
         directories which should either not exist or be empty. For each
         such directory \cb{create} first initializes a project as described
         below and then configures it by executing the \cb{configure}
         meta-operation.

         The first optional parameter to \cb{create} is the list of modules to
         load in \cb{root.build}. By default, \cb{create} appends \cb{.config}
         to the names of these modules so that only their configurations are
         loaded. You can override this behavior by specifying the period
         (\cb{.})  after the module name. You can also instruct \cb{create} to
         use the optional module load by prefixing the module name with the
         question mark (\cb{?}).

         The second optional parameter is the list of modules to load in
         \cb{bootstrap.build}. If not specified, then the \cb{test},
         \cb{dist}, and \cb{install} modules are loaded by default. The
         \cb{config} module is always loaded first.

         Besides creating project's \cb{bootstrap.build} and \cb{root.build},
         \cb{create} also writes the root \cb{buildfile} with the following
         contents:

         \
         ./: {*/ -build/}
         \

         If used, this \cb{buildfile} will build all the sub-projects
         currently present in the configuration.|

     \li|\cb{dist}

         Prepare a distribution containing all files necessary to perform all
         operations in a project. Implemented by the \cb{dist} module.|

     \li|\cb{info}

         Print basic information (name, version, source and output
         directories, etc) about one or more projects to \cb{STDOUT},
         separating multiple projects with a blank line. Each project is
         identified by its root directory target. For example:

         \
         $ b info: libfoo/ libbar/
         \

         ||

     The build system has the following built-in and pre-defined operations:

     \dl|

     \li|\cb{update}

         Update a target.|

     \li|\cb{clean}

         Clean a target.|

     \li|\cb{test}

         Test a target. Performs \cb{update} as a pre-operation. Implemented by
         the \cb{test} module.|

     \li|\cb{update-for-test}

         Update a target for testing. This operation is equivalent to the
         \cb{update} pre-operation as executed by the \cb{test} operation and
         can be used to only update what is necessary for testing. Implemented
         by the \cb{test} module.|

     \li|\cb{install}

         Install a target. Performs \cb{update} as a pre-operation. Implemented
         by the \cb{install} module.|


     \li|\cb{uninstall}

         Uninstall a target. Performs \cb{update} as a pre-operation.
         Implemented by the \cb{install} module.|

     \li|\cb{update-for-install}

         Update a target for installation. This operation is equivalent to the
         \cb{update} pre-operation as executed by the \cb{install} operation
         and can be used to only update what is necessary for
         installation. Implemented by the \cb{install} module.||

     Note that buildspec and command line variable values are treated as
     \cb{buildfile} fragments and so can use quoting and escaping as well as
     contain variable expansions and evaluation contexts. However, to be more
     usable on various platforms, escaping in these two situations is limited
     to the \i{effective sequences} of \cb{\\'}, \cb{\\\"}, \cb{\\\\},
     \cb{\\$}, and \cb{\\(} with all other sequences interpreted as is.
     Together with double-quoting this is sufficient to represent any value.
     For example:

     \
     $ b config.install.root=c:\projects\install
     $ b \"config.install.root='c:\Program Files (x86)\test\'\"
     $ b 'config.cxx.poptions=-DFOO_STR=\"foo\"'

  \h|DEFAULT OPTIONS FILES|

  Instead of having a separate config file format for tool configuration, the
  \cb{build2} toolchain uses \i{default options files} which contain the same
  options as what can be specified on the command line. The default options
  files are like options files that one can specify with \cb{--options-file}
  except that they are loaded by default.

  The default options files for the build system driver are called
  \cb{b.options} and are searched for in the \cb{.build2/} subdirectory of the
  home directory and in the system directory (for example, \cb{/etc/build2/})
  if configured.

  Once the search is complete, the files are loaded in the reverse order, that
  is, beginning from the system directory (if any), followed by the home
  directory, and finishing off with the options specified on the command line.
  In other words, the files are loaded from the more generic to the more
  specific with the command line options having the ability to override any
  values specified in the default options files.

  If a default options file contains \cb{--no-default-options}, then the
  search is stopped at the directory containing this file and no outer files
  are loaded. If this option is specified on the command line, then none of
  the default options files are searched for or loaded.

  An additional directory containing default options files can be specified
  with \cb{--default-options}. Its configuration files are loaded after the
  home directory.

  The order in which default options files are loaded is traced at the
  verbosity level 3 (\cb{-V} option) or higher.

  \h|EXIT STATUS|

  Non-zero exit status is returned in case of an error.

  \h|ENVIRONMENT|

  The \cb{HOME} environment variable is used to determine the user's home
  directory. If it is not set, then \cb{getpwuid(3)} is used instead. This
  value is used to shorten paths printed in diagnostics by replacing the home
  directory with \cb{~/}. It is also made available to \cb{buildfile}'s as the
  \cb{build.home} variable.
