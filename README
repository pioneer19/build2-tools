This is the build2 toolchain amalgamation. It includes the build system
(build2), package dependency manager (bpkg), project dependency manager
(bdep), and their prerequisite libraries as subprojects.

Note that while the MAJOR.MINIOR version components in the amalgamation and
subprojects always match, the PATCH components are incremented more or less
independently. Specifically, whenever a new patch release of a subproject is
published, an updated amalgamation with an incremented PATCH component is
released as well.

build2 is an open source, cross-platform toolchain for building and packaging
C++ code. Its aim is a modern build system and dependency manager for the C++
language that provide a consistent, out of the box interface across multiple
platforms and compilers. For more information see:
